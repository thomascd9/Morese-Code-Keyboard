Collection of all my efforts to make a morse code keyboard out of an Arduino

morse_serial
Prints out letters to serial based on morse code input. Does not do spaces

morse_simple
Turns push button input into dots and dashes

rgb_colors
exhaustive test of colors; they weren't displaying properly for me so I manually
tested them by visual inspection with brute force approach over rgb colorspace

test1
hardware test to figure out if wiring worked
